  <h3>Here is what you need to make cheesy scrambled eggs:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li id="eggs">eggs</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Cheesy scrambled eggs are really special to me.  When I need a little something that is going to stick to my ribs and get me through the day, it is a solid choice. But this simple dish gets its real meaning from the way I share it with my children. They love to join me in the kitchen. They can pretty much cook them on their own, but I am there overseeing and handing out roles. Breaking the eggs, stirring them, and being "cheese master" are all coveted roles. And the eggs are even better when averyone has a hand in making them.</p>
